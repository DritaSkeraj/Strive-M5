const multer = require("multer")
const cloudinary = require("cloudinary").v2
const { CloudinaryStorage } = require("multer-storage-cloudinary")

const cloudStorage = new CloudinaryStorage({
    cloudinary: cloudinary,
    params: {
        folder: "games"
    }
})
const cloudMulter =  multer({ storage: cloudStorage})

req.post("/whatever", cloudMulter.single("propName"), async (req, res, next))
